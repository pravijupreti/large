Hereâ€™s a README template in proper format based on your instructions for pushing large files to GitHub using Git LFS.

# Large Files GitHub Repository

This repository demonstrates how to use **Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)** to push large files to GitHub. GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB for regular files, and Git LFS helps overcome this limit by tracking and storing large files in a separate storage.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to clone the repository, track large files with Git LFS, and push them to GitHub.

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <"Repository URL">
2. Track Large Files with Git LFS
Git LFS is used to handle large files in the repository. You need to track the large files before committing them.

To track a file, for example, student_data.csv, run the following command:

git lfs track "student_data.csv"
This will create or modify the .gitattributes file to tell Git LFS to track the specified files.

3. Add Files to Git
After tracking the large file with Git LFS, add the changes (tracked files and .gitattributes file) to the staging area:

git add .gitattributes student_data.csv
4. Commit Changes
Now, commit the changes with an appropriate commit message:

git commit -m "Re-adding student_data.csv with Git LFS"
5. Push to GitHub
After committing the changes, push them to the remote repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
This will upload the large file using Git LFS and push your changes to GitHub.

6. Verify
Once the push is complete, verify that the large file has been successfully uploaded to GitHub under the LFS storage. The file will not be stored directly in the repository but will be handled by Git LFS.

Notes
GitHub's file size limit for regular files is 100 MB. Any file larger than this will need to be managed using Git LFS.
Git LFS replaces large files in the repository with small pointer files, and the actual files are stored in separate Git LFS servers.
This repository contains the file student_data.csv (which is 383 MB) stored using Git LFS.
